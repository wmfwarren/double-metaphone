# Double Metaphone for Rhyme Analysis

## Attributions
The Double Metaphone Algorithm, which this is based on, was created by Lawrence Philips.

This implementation is a fork of [Titus Wormer's](http://wooorm.com) JavaScript [implementation](https://github.com/wooorm/double-metaphone) of the original Double Metaphone Algorithm.

## Goals
The main goal of this package it to be used in an implementation of a rhyme scheme analyzer for Hip-Hop and Rap. The reason for editing this algorithm was to include approximate vowel sounds in the analysis as vowels sounds are key to rhyming in English.

## Progress

This project is still in the augmentation and testing stages.
